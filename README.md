I have made a page with a grid of shapes in random colors, some of which are randomly connected by lines.
The lines and shapes are generated with d3, but the text and the large square containing the grid are not.

Technical and Design Achievements

Learned basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG.
Used d3.selectAll() and .enter() to generate an arbitrarily large number of symbols.
Used d3.style() and .attr() to modify the symbols' position and color.
Learned to use Github Pages to host web projects.
